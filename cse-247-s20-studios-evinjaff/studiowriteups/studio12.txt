A: 0/7
B: 1/6
C: 2/3
D: 4/5
E: 8/13
F: 9/10
G: 11/12
Question B1:
No, since there's a cycle
Question B2:
v allways finishes before u in an acyclical directed graph
Question B3:
v will finish before u since u's finishing time is assigned after v
Question B4:
v will finish before u since u's finishing time is assigned after v
Question B5:
No, since we're assuming an acyclic, directed graph, this wouldn't happen
Question B6:
Proof:
v is traversed so it has a finishing time of
Question C1:
A: 0/11
B: 1/6
C: 7/10
D: 8/9
E: 2/5

Make A>C>B>E>D>F
A(0,11)
C(1,10)
B(2,9)
E(3,8)
D(4,7)
F(5,6)

Question C4:
the highest starting value has no successor, since this implies it must not have used any of its edges

Question C5:
vn's finishing time is the smallest, since it will finish immediately and then push finishes upstream
Question C6:
Starting from F
F: (0,1)
E: (2,3)
D: (4,5)
C: (6,7)
B: (7,8)
A: (8,9) 

Start DFS at vn and keep doing DFS on successive ones all the way back to v1
