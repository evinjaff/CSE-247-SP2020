Below each question, type in your short, to-the-point answers.

Question A1:



while(A[i] < inf || B[j] < inf){
	if(A[i] < B[j]){
		C[k] = A[i];
		i++;
	} 
	else{
		C[k] = B[j];
		j++;
	}
	k++;
}

Question A2:
Proved to TA
Question A3:
i+j will increase by 1 each loop
i+j will eventually reach k
Question A4:
A[i] <= A[i+1] && B[i] <= B[i+1]
and C will be sorted as a result
Question A5:
Base case:
C = 0, so there is nothing in the arrays, meaning that A[i] < A[i+1] as values outside of the array for this condition has been set at inf.
The same aplies to B[i] and B[i+1].

If we iterate to C = 4, adding either A and B will reach the end, which means that we must be adding both A's and B's values.
Since C will always pick the lowest value because A[i] < A[i+1] && B[i] < A[i+1] for all, i, so C will always select the lowest number, not violating the rules of sorted order.

Question B1:
θ(n)
Question B2:
T(n) = 2T(n/2) + cn 
Question B3:
f(n) = cn  vs n^(logbase2(2))  so n vs n

Case 2A:

k = 0

θ(n log(n))

Question B4:

T(n) = k T(n/k) + cn

Question B5:

f(n) = cn

n^(logbasek(k)) so n vs n

Case 2A

θ(n log(n))

Question C1:
Array storage:
θ(n log(n))

logbase represents splits

Question C2:
make the 2 arrays n length and sort the arrays inside to minimize space
Question C3:
Don't have to use more memory
Question C4:
treat the array as the heap
Question C5:
